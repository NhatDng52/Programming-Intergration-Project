# Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using two machine learning models: **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning models to analyze historical stock price data and make predictions.

### Models Used
1. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A type of neural network designed for sequential data, capable of capturing temporal dependencies.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An advanced version of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, making it suitable for long-term dependencies.
